How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?


making finding the error way faster than looking through all the code   


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?


    

yes, it will make youy a more efficcient programmer , becoause you wont spend so much time looking for an error you comitted before, everyone cold have a typo in their code
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

 
  its better to havce your versions saved wehenever you wants because you can keep them logical, so when you compare the commits , they could be usefull. the downside is that you have to manually save, and if you forget to do it ,
 you could haver a commit thats way too big, and it turns out to be useless



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   
 
because git is focused on programming , so you wold like to keep track of the changes made on all of the files, 
whether on google docs, is focused on tewxt editing so they wont focus on keepiung track of all of the documentts simultaneously 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  
you can use git log to see all the comits that were made in the repository,and git diff so you can compare what whas done between 2 commits  


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?


   
you knwo you alkways have a backup if you mess things up, so you can feel more free to do whaterver you want wioth the code, knowing you can go back to an initial state


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

 
   
having this tool to workl more efficciently and let my imagination fly while making a new project
